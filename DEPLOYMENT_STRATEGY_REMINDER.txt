üöÄ KOSGE BERLIN PROJECT - DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY REMINDER
================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: READ THIS BEFORE ANY DEPLOYMENT CHANGES ‚ö†Ô∏è

CURRENT DEPLOYMENT SETUP:
========================
‚úÖ NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT (PRIMARY & CORRECT)
- Repository: https://github.com/CosmicSlothOracle/kosvite.git
- Platform: Netlify (NOT GitHub Pages)
- Config File: netlify.toml
- Build Command: npm --prefix netlify/functions install && python scripts/generate_chatbot_key.py && python scripts/inject_chatbot_script.py
- Publish Directory: docs/
- Functions Directory: netlify/functions/

NETLIFY FEATURES IN USE:
=======================
‚úÖ Netlify Functions (Essential for backend)
   - /api/login ‚Üí /.netlify/functions/login
   - /api/participants ‚Üí /.netlify/functions/participants
   - /api/banners ‚Üí /.netlify/functions/banners

‚úÖ Netlify Identity (Authentication system)

‚úÖ Server-side Redirects
   - SPA routing: /* ‚Üí /index.html
   - API routing to functions

WHAT TO AVOID:
=============
‚ùå GitHub Pages deployment
‚ùå Any .github/workflows/static.yml or similar GitHub Actions
‚ùå Changing deployment platform without full migration
‚ùå Conflicting deployment configurations

KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX:
==================
üîß .github/workflows/static.yml
   - This file CONFLICTS with Netlify deployment
   - It's configured for GitHub Pages (wrong platform)
   - Should be DELETED to avoid deployment conflicts
   - GitHub Pages cannot handle Netlify Functions or Identity

DEPLOYMENT FLOW:
===============
1. Code changes pushed to main branch
2. Netlify automatically detects changes
3. Netlify runs build command from netlify.toml
4. Netlify deploys to production
5. Functions and Identity work seamlessly

REMEMBER:
=========
- Always deploy via Netlify (never GitHub Pages)
- Backend functionality requires Netlify Functions
- Authentication requires Netlify Identity
- Keep netlify.toml as the single source of truth
- Remove any conflicting GitHub Actions workflows

Project Lead: Based on memory - direct deploy to main, Netlify functions preferred
